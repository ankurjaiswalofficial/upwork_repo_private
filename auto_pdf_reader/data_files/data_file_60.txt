 61 us from the Eastern  Zeph yr. “Alas! my Laura 
(returned she ) avoid so melancholy a subject, I 
intreat you. Don’t again wound my Sensibility by 
observations on those  elms. Th ey remind  me of 
Augustus. He was like them, tall, majestic  he 
possess ed that noble grandeur which you admire 
in them. ”

unwilling ly distress her by fixing on any other 
subject of conversation which might again remind 
her of Augustus.  
        “Why do you  not speak my Laura? ( Said she 
after a sho rt pause ) I can ’t support this  silence you 
must not leave me to my own reflections ; they  
ever recur to A ugustus.”
