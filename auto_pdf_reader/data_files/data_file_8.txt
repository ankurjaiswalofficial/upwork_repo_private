 9             “Beware my Laura ( she wo uld often 
say) Bewa re of the insipid Van ities and idle 
Dissipations of the Metropolis  of England; 
Beware of t he unmeaning Luxuries of Bath 
and of the stinking fish of Southampton .” 
           “Alas! (Exclaimed  I) how am I to avoid 
those ev ils I shall never be exposed to ? What 
probability is th ere of my ever testing the 
Dissipations of London, the Luxuries of Bath, 
or the stinking F ish of Southampton ? I who 
am doomed to  waste my  Days of Youth and 
Beauty in  a humble Cottage in the  Vale of 
Uske. ” 
       Ah! Little did I then thi nk I was  ordained 
so soon to quit that humble Cottage for the 
Deceitful  Pleasures of th e World. Adeiu Laura
