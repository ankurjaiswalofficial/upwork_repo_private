 27 to Sophia, the wife of Edwa rd’s friend . After 
having  been deprived during the course of 3 
weeks of a real friend ( for such I t erm your  
Mother ) imagine my transports at beholding  one, 
most tru ly worthy of the N ame. S ophia was rather 
above the middle size; most langu or spread over 
her lovely feature s, but increase d their Beauty . It 
was the  Characteristics  of her Min d. She was all 
sensibility and feeling . We flew  into each others 
arms and afte r having exchanged vows of mutual 
Friendship  for the rest of our L ives, instantly un 
folded to each other  the most in ward secrets of 
our Hearts. We were interru pted in the deli ghtful  
Employment by the entrance of August us, 
(Edward ’s friend) who was just returned  from a 
solitary ramble.  
     Never did I see such an affecting Scene as was 
the meeting of Edward and Augustus.
