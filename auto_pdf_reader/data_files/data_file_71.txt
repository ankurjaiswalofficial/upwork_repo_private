 72 warning from my un happy End and avoid the 
imprudent c onduct which had occasioned it … 
Beware o f fainting -fits…. Though at the time 
they may be agre eable yet believe  me they wi ll 
in the end , if too often repeated and at 
improper seasons , prove destructive to your 
Constitution … My fate will teach you this...  I 
die a Martyr to my grief for the lo ss of 
Augustus … One fatal swoon has cost me 
Life... Beware of swoon Dear Laura … A 
frenzy fit is not  one quarter so pernicious; it is 
an exercise to the Body and if not too violent, 
is I da re say conductive to Health in its 
consequences . Run mad as often as you chuse; 
but don ’t faint ”
