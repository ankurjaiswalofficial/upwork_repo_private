 74 of my Fellow -travellers ; I could only perceive 
that they were many. Regar dless however of 
anything  concerning them , I gave myself up to 
my own sad Reflections. A general silence 
prevailed A silence, which was by nothing 
interrupted but by the loud and repeated 
snores of one of the Party.  
          “What an illiterate villain must that man 
be! (Thought I to myself) What a total want of 
delicate refinement must have, who can thus 
shock our senses by such a brutal noise! He 
must I’m certain be capable of every bad 
action! There is no crime too black for such a 
Character!” Thus reasoned I within myself, 
and doubtless such were  the reflections of my 
fellow travellers.
