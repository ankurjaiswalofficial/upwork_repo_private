Letter 2nd  Laura to Isab el 
 
        Altho ’ I can’t agree with You in supposing that  I hall never 
again be exposed to Misfortunes as unmerited  as those I have 
already  experienced , yet to avoid the imputation of Obstinacy or 
ill-nature, I will gratify th e curio sity of your daughter; and many 
the fortitude  with which I have suffered the man y afflictions of 
my past Lif e, prove to her a usefu l lesson for the support of 
those  which may befall h er in her own. Laura
