 10 Letter 5th Laura to Mariann e 
     One Even ing in December  as my father , 
my mother  and myself, were arranged in socia l 
converse round our Fireside, we were on a 
sudden greatly ast onish ed, by he aring a violent 
Knocking on the outward door of ou r rustic 
Cot. 
       My Father started” What  noise is that” 
(said he. ) “It Sound s like a load rapping at the 
door” (replied my mother. ) ”It does indeed, ” 
(cried I. )” I’m  of your opinion;  (said m y 
father ) it certainly does appear to proc eed 
from some uncommon violence exerted 
against  our unoffending door .” “Yes 
(exclaime d I) I can ’t help thinking it must be 
somebody who knocks  for admittance. ”
