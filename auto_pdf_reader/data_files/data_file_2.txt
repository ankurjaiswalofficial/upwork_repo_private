Letter the First form Isabel to Laura  
           How often, in answer to my repeated instreaties that  you 
would give my daughter  a regular detail  of the Misfortunes and 
Adventures of tour Life , have you said “No, my friend never 
will I comp ly with your request till I may be no longer in Danger 
of again exp eriencing such d readful ones. ” 
 
          Surely that time is now at hand . You are this day 55. If a 
woman may ever be said to be i n safety from the determined 
Perseverance  of disagreeable Lovers and of obstinate Fath ers, 
surly it must be at such a time of Lif e. Isabel
