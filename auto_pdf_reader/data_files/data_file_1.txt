 Transcriber’s  
Note:  
 
 
    A few very 
small changes 
have been made 
to this version: 
Italics have been 
converted to 
capital s. The 
British  ‘poun d’ 
symbol has been 
converted t o ‘L’; 
but in gene ral the 
author’s erratic  
spelling , 
punctuation and 
capitalisation  
have been 
retained
